            <p>
                I've always been fascinated by technology and took a particular interest in computer hardware.
                One of my favorite hobbies is discussing and building custom PCs. It's always fun to learn how a desktop functions on the hardware level, 
                as well as the act of building giving me a sense of accomplishment, when I get to use a computer I have built myself.
